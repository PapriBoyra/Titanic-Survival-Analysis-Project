# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Analysis Project**! In this data analysis project, you will explore how various factors influenced the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. This is a hands-on opportunity to sharpen your data manipulation, visualization, and analytical thinking skills using real-world data from one of the most tragic maritime disasters in history.

---

## 🧠 Project Background

The **sinking of the Titanic** in 1912 is a historical event that offers a rich dataset for analysis. Through this project, we aim to understand how **socio-economic status, gender, age, family structure**, and other factors influenced a passenger's likelihood of survival.

By diving into this dataset using **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, you’ll uncover survival patterns and draw meaningful conclusions.

## 🎯 Objectives

The key goals of this project include:

- 🔍 Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- 📊 Visualizing survival rates by **class**, **gender**, **age**, **family size**, etc.
- 🧮 Conducting **statistical analysis** of survival data.
- 🧠 Gaining actionable insights from historical passenger data.

## 🛠 Skills & Concepts Covered

- **Data Manipulation** with NumPy and Pandas
- **Data Visualization** with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- **Statistical Analysis**
- **Insight Derivation** from survival data

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed records of Titanic passengers, with the following fields:

| Column        | Description                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `PassengerId` | Unique ID for each passenger                            |
| `Survived`    | 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived                       |
| `Pclass`      | Passenger class (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower)|
| `Name`        | Full name of the passenger                              |

| `Parch`       | # of parents/children aboard                            |
| `Ticket`      | Ticket number                                           |
| `Fare`        | Fare paid                                               |
| `Cabin`       | Cabin number (can be missing)                           |
| `Embarked`    | Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |
